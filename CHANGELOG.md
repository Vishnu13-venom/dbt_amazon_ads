## ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Amazon Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Amazon Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads_source).
- Provides insight into your ad performance across the following grains:
  - Account, portfolio, campaign, ad group, ad, keyword, and search term
- Materializes output models designed to work simultaneously with our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Amazon Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_amazon_ads/).
